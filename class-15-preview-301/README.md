## Advanced JS Topics

We're going to explore some advanced JS topics with [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/). The goal is not to study them in a manner such that you are going to immediately have command over them, but to give you a basic understanding of what these topics are and find good resources for them.

- Advanced HTML Templating
- Intermediate JavaScript
- jQuery Events & DOM Manipulation
