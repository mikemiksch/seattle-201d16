# Today's Plan: Week 3, Wednesday Lecture

On Friday afternoon we'll publish the entrance exam for Code 301, which doubles as the final exam for this course, and it will be due by Monday night by 11:59pm. Do take this exam even if you are not planning to go to Code 301 right away, as it is part of your grade for this course. The exam is a bit different from the quizzes for multiple reasons:

1. It is longer: 25 questions. (Still all multiple-guess, at least)
2. It is administered by a company called EdRepublic and is actually their exam mechanism embedded in Canvas, so it is going to look a little different.
3. You only get one attempt at taking it. No re-dos.

## UI & UX Discussion

Let's have a discussion on UI/UX, and also look at a few websites (some awesome, some kind of randomly chosen) relating to design and interaction.

- [All Websites Look the Same](http://www.zeldman.com/2015/09/10/all-websites-look-the-same/)
- [5 Ridiculously Common Misconceptions about UX](https://www.sitepoint.com/5-ridiculously-common-misconceptions-about-ux/)
- [The A11Y Project](http://a11yproject.com/)
- [10 Web design trends you can expect to see on websites in 2015](http://thenextweb.com/dd/2015/01/02/10-web-design-trends-can-expect-see-2015/)
- [40 Stunning Website Designs with Great Color Schemes](http://www.onextrapixel.com/2013/10/25/40-stunning-website-designs-with-great-color-schemes/)
- [Practical Typography](http://practicaltypography.com/)
- [Seattle Times project on the Ehlwa River](https://github.com/seattletimes/elwha)

When you start with your own projects, one of the things you will be fully responsible for is UI and UX. Be thoughtful.

## Project Pitches

Let's hear the first round of project pitches! We'll keep track of them in this document.
