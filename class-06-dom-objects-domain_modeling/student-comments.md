# Student Comments from Week 1

### WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE MOST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

- Having Frazier in class

- The lab work time is phenomenal. I would never be able to get this done at home, and it's good to have the TA and instructor around to answer the questions that arise rather than forcing me to bang my head against a brick wall until I either understand it or bash my brains out.

- Presence of both instructor and TA to help students when needed. As well of both of their persistence to make you ask questions.

- I love the code demos in class. They really help but it'd be great if they were more accessible. Sometimes they don't get posted before we start on our labs for the day. I haven't had a chance to watch the class youtube but I expect that to be incredibly useful. We had Sam as a stand-in instructor today. It was nice to see a different approach. His pace was a lot easier to follow.

### WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE LEAST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

- Listening to lectures are not my strong suit when it comes to learning. I find that parroting through action then trying out on my own works best for me.

- The course load is heavy but I understand why. There's a lot of info to take in, in a short amount of time.

- Readings. They mostly repeat material learned in CodeCademy.

### DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, SUGGESTIONS, OR CONCERNS?

- There is one instructor, whom I do not interact with directly but he is usually present during afternoon labs to help his students. He talks REALLY LOUDLY and kind of obnoxiously. I feel bad complaining about him but I do think that he could be a bit more respectful considering folks are trying to concentrate in the public area. I don't know his name but he has a nose ring and kind of talks like a surfer dude. The Code Fellows new space is fantastic, however, the fluorescent lights are killing me. It would nice if there were more natural lighting or just less brightness. When looking at computer for hours, eyes fatigued and the fluorescents don't help with that! Overall I've been really impressed. The staff is super friendly and helpful and I really like the way CF is run. Great program and I feel lucky to have the opportunity to be here!
